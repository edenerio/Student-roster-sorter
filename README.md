# Student roster sorter
 This is my CSCI313 (Data Structure) Final Project. This Java program essentially takes a list of students (given in a text file roster.txt) and sorts the list alphabetically wiith their last name. If 2 students have the same last name, these 2 students' first names will be compared, then their Student ID number.
 
 This program allows the user to add / remove students before the roster is finally being sorted and printed to a text file (studentRoster.txt).
